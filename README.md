# Exploring SF Public Library Usage Data with Python
Hello and welcome to a beginner-friendly Python walkthrough for exploring a large public library dataset!

This repository contains a guided Python exercise that introduces basic data exploration and visualization using a real-world dataset from the San Francisco Public Library. The goal of this project is not to master Python or perform an exhaustive analysis, but to show how a few core Python libraries and lines of code can help make large datasets easier to understand, summarize, and question (especially in library, archive, and museum contexts).

This notebook builds from a Python lab lesson I taught at UCLA's MLIS program in Fall 2025. I have built this notebook and cleaned the Google CoLab notebook as a teaching exercise for a guest lecture for a UCLA MLIS course in Winter 2026. This is a part of a lesson emphasizing how to get oriented within large MLIS datasets, how to identify patterns and gaps, and how to think critically about what data does (and does not) capture.

## What’s in this repository
### CoLab Notebooks:
Both notebooks were created using Google Colab and can be opened directly in Colab to run interactively in your browser.

*SF_Library_Exercise_v1.ipynb* - This is the main exercise notebook. It includes guidance explanations and lines of code to run as you work your way through the notebook.

*ANSWERS_SF_Library_Exercise_ANSWERS_v1.ipynb* - This is the completed version of the notebook. If you get stuck, confused, or want to check your work, this file shows all code and visualizations filled in.

### Data File:
*SF_Library_Usage_2016_v1.csv.zip* - A zipped CSV file containing library usage data from the San Francisco Public Library’s Integrated Library System (ILS) published in 2017. The dataset includes anonymized patron records with information such as patron type, year of registration, and circulation activity.

### Other Files:
*LICENSE* - License information for this repository. In following the SF Public Library Dataset, which was published under the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License, this repository and information is also Public Domain.

## How to use this project
- Open SF_Library_Exercise_v1.ipynb in Google Colab
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data and explore it step by step
- Eperiment with the code and visualizations. If you run into trouble or want to compare results, open Copy_of_SF_Library_Exercise_ANSWERS_v1.ipynb.
